          I am a former attorney licensed to practice law in Brazil.
          I always have been in love with technology, mainly software and apps.
          As it would take me some years to become licensed to practise law in Canada, I decided to look around me at other opportunities that this country offered and change my career to the tech industry seeking new challenges and personal growth.
